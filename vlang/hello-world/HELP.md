## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `v test .` from within the exercise directory.

If you want to see all the tests that were run along with statistics on speed, use `v -stats test .`

For more information on testing in V, please see [the documentation](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md#testing).

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit hello-world.v` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
